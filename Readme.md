# Koombea's iOS Technical Interview

This is the exercise developed in the technical interview.  
These are the possibles improvements discovered during the interview:
  * Better UI
  * Subscript to make collections nullable when index is out of range
  * Show Errors in the view if needed
  * Testing

As a part of a fair process I will send the test as it was in the interview. However, I will also try to finish them in another branch called `chore/improvements-and-feautures`
